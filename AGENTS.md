# AGENTS

## Source of truth
- ONLY `docs/spec/source/*.pdf` are requirements.
- `docs/spec/index.md` is navigation/workflow guidance, NOT requirements.
- Always start work by reading `docs/spec/index.md` and the relevant PDFs.
- Any implementations/tests/UX/data must conform to the PDFs.
- If decisions/assumptions are required, record them in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Do not invent requirements and do not treat chat as a source of requirements.
- When you implement or change behavior, cite PDF filename + page number(s) in the PR/commit message or in a `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry.
