# AGENTS

## Source of truth
- `docs/spec/source/*.pdf` and `docs/spec/index.md` are the source of truth.
- Always start work by reading `docs/spec/index.md`.
- Any implementations/tests/UX/data must conform to the PDFs.
- If decisions/assumptions are required, record them in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Do not invent requirements and do not treat chat as a source of requirements.
