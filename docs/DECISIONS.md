## 2026-02-02 — PDFs are the only requirements source of truth
- Date: 2026-02-02
- Title: PDFs in docs/spec/source are the only requirements source of truth
- Context: The spec defines a staged release plan and Definition of Done that require explicit, testable references for implementation and release gating.
- Decision: Treat only `docs/spec/source/*.pdf` as requirements; use `docs/spec/index.md` for navigation only; require PDF+page citations in decisions/PRs when behavior changes.
- Alternatives: Use README/index as co-equal requirements or allow implicit requirements from chat.
- Consequences: All implementation notes must point to PDF pages; decisions and PRs will carry citations.
